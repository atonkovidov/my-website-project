    <br>
    <p>All the way from its very humble beginnings to the quaint yet prosperous tourist destination it is today, Toluca Lake has been dogged by bouts of great hardships but also great resilience. Although details are sketchy, it is believed that the land upon which Toluca Lake was founded was originally a shared living area between an unknown Native American tribelet and a small band of Pilgrims. Relations eventually soured, as is unfortunately common in early American history. Many Natives were killed or violently driven from the land. Some attributed the repeated spread of infectious disease that ravaged through the residing Pilgrim population following this unjust exodus as an Indian curse of retribution.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Civil War came just as the population finally settled down and local doctors were able to manage new outbreaks effectively. From a group of nearly 150 people, half were able-bodied men who bravely enlisted. It is unimaginable what shock the small community must have felt when only 2 returned alive by the end of the war. This left the town with only 4 men: 2 were middle-aged doctors who were needed in the town and couldn't enlist. This fact ensured that women had to assume roles of authority and leadership in the town, not only during the war but also today.</p>
